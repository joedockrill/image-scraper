# DuckDuckGo Image Scraper

This was originally an image scraper notebook for creating deep learning datasets.

It has since been turned into an installable library and is much easier to use as you can simply drop a few lines of code into your own notebook as you're experimenting. 

This notebook now shows you how to use the library.

Docs are at [joedockrill.github.io/jmd_imagescraper/](https://joedockrill.github.io/jmd_imagescraper/)

Hugs & kisses, Joe Dockrill.
